# Release Notes

## 2024.1 Release Candidate

This is a new curriculum in the iSAQB Advanced Series, approved by the
Strategy Council in September 2023.

The material was written by Michael Sperber, Lars Hupel, Adina
Aniculaesei, Bianca Lutz, CHristina Zeller, and Klaus-JÃ¶rn Lange, with
help by Mahbouba Gharbi,Gerrit Beine, Ulrich Becker, and Isabella
Stilkerich.

This curriculum intends to provide a collection of formal methods to
supplement and replace the traditional architect's arsenal. These
methods produce mathematical proofs of critical system properties. To
enable the use of these methods, the architecture needs to be designed
from the start to be amenable to such proof.

Our hope is that this curriculum will lead to a renewed focus on
formulating proper specifications, and ensuring that the software
systems we build meet those requirements.
